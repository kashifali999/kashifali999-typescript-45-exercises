// Number Eight: Write addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations that each result in the number 8. Be sure to enclose your operations in print statements to see the results.
//======================================================================================================================================
//I am suppose to use four basic arithmetic operations in such a way that each operation produces figure eight "8" as answer.
//I also added "\n" for clear output.
//lets go for addition
var num1 = 6;
var num2 = 2;
console.log("\nAddition");
console.log(num1 + num2);
//lets go for subtraction
var num3 = 14;
var num4 = 6;
console.log("\nSubtraction");
console.log(num3 - num4);
//lets go for multiplication
var num5 = 2;
var num6 = 4;
console.log("\nMultiplication");
console.log(num5 * num6);
//lets go for division
var num7 = 40;
var num8 = 5;
console.log("\nDivision");
console.log(num7 / num8);

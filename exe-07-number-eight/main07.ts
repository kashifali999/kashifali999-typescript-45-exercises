// Number Eight: Write addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations that each result in the number 8. Be sure to enclose your operations in print statements to see the results.

//I am suppose to use four basic arithmetic operations in such a way that each operation produces figure eight "8" as answer.
//I also added "\n" for clear output.
